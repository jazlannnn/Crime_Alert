# Crime Alert Management System (CRIMELERT)

In my 4th semester, my colleagues and I developed CRIMELERT, a web-based application designed to provide a platform for users to report crimes directly to the police without needing to visit a police station. 
The system also enables the police department to efficiently manage crime reports, track the status of investigations, and analyze crime patterns. 
The primary goal of CRIMELERT is to enhance public safety, improve law enforcement efficiency, and promote community engagement.

Technologies Used: Java, JSP, Servlets, JavaBeans, DAO (Data Access Object), NetBeans IDE 8.2, Bootstrap

Key Features and Achievements :

Crime Reporting and Management: Developed a secure platform where users can create accounts and submit detailed crime reports. The police department can log in, view, and manage these reports efficiently.

CRUD Operations: Implemented the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing users to submit incidents, view their reports, update information, and delete entries when necessary.

Investigation Tracking: Enabled law enforcement to update the status of investigations, providing transparency and real-time information for both authorities and the public.

Crime Pattern Analysis: Integrated analytical tools to visualize and identify crime patterns, aiding the police department in proactive decision-making and resource allocation.

Secure Authentication: Implemented secure login mechanisms for both users and the police department, ensuring data privacy and system integrity.

This project significantly enhanced my understanding of web development using Java and related technologies like JSP, Servlets, and JavaBeans. I gained practical experience in building and managing database-driven applications 
through the DAO pattern, while also improving my skills in front-end and back-end integration. Additionally, the development of this system sharpened my problem-solving skills 
and broadened my perspective on how technology can be applied to enhance public safety and law enforcement efficiency.
